# Briefly describe your project and its use case.

## âœ¨ Inspiration

The eagerness to provide solutions to the issue of low-quality NFT projects, AI and games was a major inspiration. This idea came up because a big part of our combined interest was in the NFT utility. When more and more NFT platforms came out, we were researching existing NFT marketplaces and their limitations. We saw incredible chains that lack the NFT utility in scale, which stops them from revealing their true potential. As the crypto space evolved, and the infrastructure got improved, we decided to create an all-in-one solution that will ease the user experience of the NFTverse.

We have identified the issue of lack of quality NFT projects, AI and games, despite its advanced technology, and we thought it was because of the lack of robust NFT infrastructure. So our team has decided to develop just that - an all-in-one NFT infrastructure that combines the NFT marketplace, AI image generation, NFT minting platform, NFT Staking, NFT Editor for content creation, NFT Drawing and minting, NFT materialization service, and A bounty to win NFTs.
